# upitt_workflow
Using the xonomy javascript library to provide an XML editor.  This library is stored in /libraries/xonomy.

Also, the xonomy library does not work with jquery 1.4.4, so the jquery 3.1.1 has been added under /misc/jquery-3.1.1.min.js and is loaded explicitely for this module ONLY for the workflow/object/%/METS/edit page.
